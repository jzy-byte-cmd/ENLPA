I
have
a
little
dog
It
stands
by
me
And
it
can
see
a
book
and
a
bag



I
have
a
little
cat
He
has
a
red
cap
Let
him
have
a
rest
And
he
can
catch
a
rat



The
sea
is
blue
The
grass
is
green
The
clouds
are
white
As
they
pass
slowly
The
crows
are
black
The
trees
are
brown
The
red
sails
of
a
ship
is
in
the
breeze

It
is
Saturday
The
Browns

are
at
home
Mrs
Brown
is
in
the
kitchen
She’s
making
apple
pies
The
pies
she
makes
are
very
delicious
Do
you

want
to
have
a
taste
Mr
Brown
isn’t
in
the
living
room
He
is
outside
He
is
washing
his
car
The
car
is
new
and
very
beautiful
So
he
looks
after
it
very
well
Jim
is
in
the
garden
He
is
playing
football
with
some
other
boys
Where
is
his
sister
Sue
She’s
in
her
bedroom
with
her
friend
Ann
They
are
watching
the
Animal
World

Once
an
old
man
went
to
see
a
doctor
The
doctor
looked
him
over
carefully
and
said
Medicine
won’t
help
you
You
must
have
a
good
rest
Go
to
bed
early
drink
milk
walk
a
lot
and
smoke
one
cigar
a
day
Go
to
the
country
place
for
a
month




After
a
month
the
man
came
to
the
doctor
again
How
are
you

said
the
doctor
I’m
glad
to
see
you
again
You
look
much
younger
OH
Doctor
I
feel
quite
well
now
said
the
man
I
had
a
good
rest
I
went
to
bed
early
drank
a
lot
of
milk
and
walked
a
lot
Your
advice
certainly
helped
me
but
you
told
me
to
smoke
one
cigar
a
day
almost
killed
me
first
It’s
no
joke
to
start
smoking
at
my
age
